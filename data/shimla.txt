                 "place name":"Shimla",
                 "Geography":"Shimla is on the south-western ranges of the Himalayas at 31.61°N 77.10°E. It has an average altitude of 2,206 metres (7,238 ft) above mean sea level and 
                              extends along a ridge with seven spurs. The city stretches nearly 9.2 kilometres (5.7 mi) from east to west.[20] Shimla was built on top of seven hills:
                              Inverarm Hill, Observatory Hill, Prospect Hill, Summer Hill, Bantony Hill, Elysium Hill and Jakhoo Hill. The highest point in Shimla is the Jakhoo hill,
                              which is at a height of 2,454 metres (8,051 ft).Simla and Jutogh, 1911 mapThe city is a Zone IV (High Damage Risk Zone) per the Earthquake hazard zoning of
                              India. Weak construction techniques and an increasing population pose a serious threat to the already earthquake prone region.[21][22] There are no water 
                              bodies near the main city and the closest river, the Sutlej, is about 21 km (13 mi) away.[23] Other rivers that flow through the Shimla district, although 
                              further from the city, are the Giri, and Pabbar (both tributaries of Yamuna).
                              The green belt in the Shimla planning area is spread over 414 hectares (1,020 acres).[15] The main forests in and around the city are of pine, deodar, oak 
                              and rhododendron.[24] Environmental degradation due to the increasing number of tourists every year without the infrastructure to support them has resulted in 
                              Shimla losing its popular appeal as an ecotourism spot.[25] Another rising concern in the region are the frequent number of landslides that often take place 
                              after heavy rains.[21][26]The city is situated 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Kalka, 116 km (72 miles) northeast of Chandigarh, 247 km (154 miles) south of 
                              Manali and 350 km (219 miles) northeast of Delhi, the national capital. Kalka can be reached within 2.5 hours, Chandigarh can be reached in 3 hours and 15 
                              minutes. Delhi and Manali are both around 7 hours away from Shimla.",
          
                 "Climate":"Shimla features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under the Köppen climate classification. The climate in Shimla is predominantly cool during winters and 
                            moderately warm during summer.[27] Temperatures typically range from -4 °C (25 °F) to 31 °C (88 °F) over the course of a year.[28]The average temperature during
                            summer is between 19 and 28 °C (66 and 82 °F), and between -1 and 10 °C (30 and 50 °F) in winter. Monthly precipitation varies between 15 millimetres (0.59 in) 
                            in November and 434 millimetres (17.1 in) in August. It is typically around 45 millimetres (1.8 in) per month during winter and spring, and around 175 millimetres
                            (6.9 in) in June as the monsoon approaches.
                            The average total annual precipitation is 1,575 millimetres (62 in), which is much less than most other hill stations but still much heavier than on the plains. 
                            Snowfall in the region, which historically has taken place in the month of December, has lately (over the last fifteen years) been happening  in January or early
                            February every year.[29]The maximum snowfall received in recent times was 38.6 centimetres (15.2 in) on 18 January 2013. On two consecutive days 
                            (17 and 18 January 2013), the town received 63.6 centimetres (25.0 in) of snow.[30]",
